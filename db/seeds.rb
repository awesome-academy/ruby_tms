# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
# User.create!(name: "admin", username: "admin",
#   password: "123456", role: 1, description: "Administrator - Trainer")

# 10.times do |n|
#   name = Faker::Name.name
#   username = "user#{n+1}"
#   password = "123456"
#   User.create!(name: name, username: username, password: password,
#   description: "Trainee")
# end
